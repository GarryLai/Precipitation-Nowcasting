# Precipitation-Nowcasting

This project uses pre-processed radar data provided by Shenzhen Meteorological Bureau to estimate precipitation within the next two hours

This is an easy-to-understand implementation of ConvLSTM model(fisrt proposed by [Xinjian Shi et al.])(https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04214https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04214) in a real-world precipitation nowcasting problem with Pytorch. Here presents the guide on how to run this project by yourself. Enjoy!


## DATA

##### Two datasets are available for training and testing in this project.
1. Tianchi CNKI 2017 dataset（Provided by Shenzhen Meteorological Bureau）.You can download the datasets [here](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/information.htm?spm=5176.100067.5678.2.6d453864enogCW&raceId=231596)
