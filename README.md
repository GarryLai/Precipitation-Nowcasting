# Precipitation-Nowcasting

This project uses pre-processed radar data provided by Shenzhen Meteorological Bureau to estimate precipitation within the next two hours

This is an easy-to-understand implementation of ConvLSTM model(fisrt proposed by [Xinjian Shi et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04214https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04214) in a real-world precipitation nowcasting problem with Pytorch. Here presents the guide on how to run this project by yourself. Enjoy!
